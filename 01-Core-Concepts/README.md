# Core Concepts of ML



Before coding, I'd like to introduce some core concepts of Machine Learning to you first. When it comes to machine learning, these concepts appear everywhere. 

Because github does not support latex, please open the ![pdf version]([https://github.com/Hongyu-Li/machine-learning-from-scratch/blob/master/01-Core-Concepts/Core%20Concepts%20of%20ML.pdf](https://github.com/Hongyu-Li/machine-learning-from-scratch/blob/master/01-Core-Concepts/Core Concepts of ML.pdf) to see details.
